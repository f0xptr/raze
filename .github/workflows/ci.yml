# Workflow for Rust Continuous Integration
# This workflow is triggered on pushes to main/master branches and pull requests
# targeting those branches. It builds, tests, and lints the Rust project.
name: Rust CI

# Configure when this workflow runs
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master # Also trigger on 'master' for older repositories or projects
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master # Also trigger on 'master' for older repositories or projects

# Define environment variables available to all jobs in this workflow
env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always # Always show colored output from Cargo commands

# Define the jobs that make up this workflow
jobs:
  build_and_test:
    name: Build and Test # Name of the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specifies the runner environment for this job

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # This step checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
      # so your workflow can access it.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

      # Step 2: Install Rust toolchain
      # Installs a stable Rust toolchain and specified components (rustfmt, clippy).
      - name: Install Rust toolchain
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          toolchain: stable
          components: rustfmt, clippy # Install rustfmt for formatting checks and clippy for linting

      # Step 3: Cache Cargo dependencies
      # Caches Cargo's build artifacts and downloaded dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
      - name: Cache Cargo dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v5
        with:
          path: | # Paths to cache
            ~/.cargo/registry
            ~/.cargo/git
            target
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }} # Cache key based on OS and Cargo.lock
          restore-keys: | # Keys to try restoring if the primary key misses
            ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-

      # Step 4: Check code formatting with rustfmt
      # Ensures the code adheres to the project's formatting standards.
      - name: Check formatting
        run: cargo fmt --check # --check flag ensures it only checks, not modifies

      # Step 5: Run clippy linter
      # Static analysis tool to catch common mistakes and improve Rust code.
      - name: Run clippy linter
        run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings # -D warnings treats all clippy lints as errors

      # Step 6: Build the project
      # Compiles the Rust project.
      - name: Build
        run: cargo build --verbose # --verbose provides more detailed output

      # Step 7: Run tests
      # Executes all unit and integration tests for the project.
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test --verbose # --verbose provides more detailed output
